# ForestOptiLM Roadmap

## 0. Recovery

- Fix local launch on Windows when `.venv` points to a removed Python installation.
- Keep LM Studio transport compatible with current REST v1 (`/api/v1/*`) and OpenAI-compatible (`/v1/*`) endpoints.
- Make URL handling tolerant of `host`, `host/v1`, `host/api/v1`, and copied endpoint URLs.
- Add a smoke test that checks model listing, one short chat request, and embeddings against a running LM Studio server.

## 1. Stabilization

- Split provider transport code from `processor.py` into a small client module with typed request/response adapters.
- Add mocked tests for model catalog parsing, context detection, reasoning fallback, load/unload lifecycle, and embeddings.
- Replace global runtime flags with an explicit immutable run configuration passed through GUI and processing layers.
- Add structured error messages for: server unavailable, model missing, unsupported payload option, context overflow, and embedding model mismatch.

## 2. Usability

- Auto-refresh models on startup, but keep the UI responsive and show a clear status when LM Studio is offline.
- Filter model dropdowns by model type: chat, vision, embedding.
- Add a preflight panel that shows selected model availability, loaded context, API mode, and expected chunk size before starting.
- Persist successful runtime context per model and invalidate it when LM Studio reports a different loaded instance config.

## 3. Quality

- Improve final report validation with checks for evidence coverage, duplicate findings, unsupported critical/high severity, and missing recommendations.
- Add deterministic fixtures for MAP/REDUCE prompts so regressions can be tested without a live LLM.
- Add export formats for Markdown, JSON evidence, and CSV evidence matrix.
- Track run metrics in SQLite: duration, retries, failed chunks, model, context, and quality warnings.

## 4. Architecture

- Move GUI, processing, extraction, retrieval, and provider clients into a package layout (`forestoptilm/`).
- Add a CLI entry point for headless batch runs.
- Introduce a plugin-like provider interface for LM Studio, Ollama, llama.cpp server, and generic OpenAI-compatible APIs.
- Add CI for lint, type-check, unit tests, and packaging.

## 5. Product Finish

- Create a first-run setup flow for LM Studio URL, API key, default models, and smoke test.
- Add resumable jobs with a visible run history.
- Add a project/session concept so indexes, cache, logs, and outputs are grouped by user task.
- Ship signed Windows release artifacts once the recovery and stabilization phases are complete.
